Crisis Recovery/Disaster Response Systems for calamity affected people

# DECLARATION 

The basic structured backbone of HTML and CSS codes were mostly prebuilt by me and my teammates.
But most of the unique features like Emergency SOS System,Designing Layouts,GPS Google Maps and API Integration that we specifically incorporated while building this website are developed exclusively within this Hackout Hackathon timeline period.
We also worked totally on writing the javascript code and built the unique Live Chatbot Supporting System only during the stipulated period of this Hackathon.
Apart from that the actual HTML and CSS coding editing for providing necessary informations and details were exclusively done by my teammmates today itself,I can assure about that.
Due to less time and integrating so many features within our website during this time bound hackathon, we regret to not provide the live site deployment link in the Devfolio Submission.
But our project ran successfully on our local server of VSCode  and from there we recorded the total working of our project, explained specifically and concisely and shared the necessary video links during submission

# PROBLEM IT SOLVES AND UNIQUE FEATURES OF PROJECT -

Bharat Combat Forces is a platform that integrates real-time data, geospatial information & communication tools to facilitate efficient coordination and resource allocation during crises, be it natural disasters, public health emergencies, or security threats.

The most unique features that we built within our website are
1.Firstly & foremost is the "Emergency SOS System".It is a safety feature that allows individuals to quickly & discreetly call for help & share their location with emergency services in urgent situations, often available on mobile devices & wearables.
It is supported with important emergency contact numbers of Government & NGOs & a toll free instant calling No "125" that will provide instant support.

2.Next is the most notable Emergency Chatbot system, which is an AI-powered platform equipped with preloaded, unique information on various natural calamities such as earthquakes, floods, cyclones, landslides & fires, designed to provide immediate & accurate guidance during crisis situations.

3.Thirdly the "Sahaya Seva" which is actually a donation portal for disaster-affected people.It facilitates the collection of financial contributions and essential supplies to provide relief to those in isolated regions impacted by disasters.

4.Apart from these if someone wants to learn about the natural calamities that can affect them,they can surely join our well crafted webinars free of cost through zoom platform by just one click registration facility.Here we will collaborate with our disaster experts & different geolological climatologists who will provide you the right guidance on what to do & what to avoid to save yourself & your near ones during calamities.

5.Lastly if someone wants to volunteer as part of our organization they are welcome.For their action plan we have introduced GPS & Google Maps assisted Collection Centres across different locations.The funding of food clothes and first aid will be completely tracked through our website.
